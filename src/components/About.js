        Back in 2012, I tried my hand with a relatively new company in the disaster recovery sector. Since Hurricane Sandy in 2012, I have tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of disaster recovery project management. Fast forward to today, I've had the privilege of working on some of the most rewarding projects, with some of the best people, and innovating operational procedures for such an interesting and great company.

        My main focus these days is maintaining a smooth operating network for ongoing recovery operations.

        When I'm not chasing storms, I'm usually at home building custom AI models or doing DIY projects around the house.
